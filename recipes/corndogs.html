<p>One of my go to foods at the county fair is the corn dog. I just love the deep fried bredding used to make corn dogs</p>
    <p>A corn dog is a sausage (usually a hot dog) that has been skewered, coated in a cornmeal batter, and deep-fried. A staple of American cuisine, the street food was likely invented by German immigrants in Texas in the 1920s.</p>
